# ðŸŒ¹ Rose Curve NFT Collection
The Rose Curve NFT Collection is a generative art project based on [rhodonea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_%28mathematics%29) or rose curves. They were discovered by an Italian mathematician, Guido Grandi in the early 18th century. They form very aesthetically pleasing circles, called petals that have been used to create beautiful NFTs such as floral mandalas as part of this collection.

The project is built on top of the [open palette](https://www.openpalette.io/) NFT collection which is a fantastic project deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It is a collection of randomized colour palettes made of 5 unique colours that anybody can use to create generative art, games, website themes and more. The colour of the palettes is used to generate and colour the petals of the Rose Curve NFT Collection. Thus, to mint a Rose Curve NFT, you need to own an Open Palette NFT first.

The Rose Curve project will be deployed on the Polygon blockchain to avoid the crazy gas fees of Ethereum. It will also make use of Chainlink VRF to generate a truly randomized NFT collection.
