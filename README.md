# Rhodonea curve NFTs coloured with open palettes (see https://www.openpalette.io/)
The goal of the project is to build an NFT collection on top of the open palette standard.  
It still needs to be determined but the collection will be deployed on the Polygon network (to avoid the crazy fees of Ethereum) and it will certainly use Chainlink VRF.
